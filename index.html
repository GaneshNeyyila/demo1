                    <h3>What is PNR?</h3>
                    <p>
                        â€‹PNR is short name for 'Passenger Name Record'. It is a record in the database of Indian
                        Railways against which the journey details for a passenger, or a group of passengers are stored.
                        Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) also maintains information like current PNR status
                        of the passengers, availability of berths in all classes for the next 60 days and static
                        enquiries like Train Between Important Stations, Reservations Rules, Fares, Refund, and Rules
                        etc When a reserved railway ticket is booked for a train in Indian Railways, all the details of
                        passengers are stored in relational database of centralized reservation system. These details
                        are associated with a unique ten digit number. This reference number is called PNR. PNR number
                        is generally printed at the top left corner of the printed tickets. In case of the E â€“ Ticket,
                        it is mentioned at top in separate cell. Passenger's personal information like name, age, gender
                        etc. is saved in the database against this reference number. It includes columns to store
                        booking status and current status of the ticket. As we know every train has limited number of
                        seats, sometime one may not get a confirmed reserved ticket. The current status of such a
                        waitlist (W/L) ticket changes when there is any availability of reserved seats due to
                        cancellation. This new current reservation status is generally known as PNR status.

                        days of the week, seasonality, holidays etc. Generally waiting list PNR Status during peak
                        seasons like Durga puja(Dussehra), Diwali, Chhath, Holi etc has very fewer chances to get
                        confirmed. This is due to a large number of commuters travelling to their hometowns. Even during

                        PNR is an abbreviation for 'Passenger Name Record'. As the term suggests, when you book a
                        ticket, an entry is created in your name and a 10-digit unique id is allotted against your
                        transaction. This is your â€˜PNR numberâ€™. This id is the key to figure a variety of information
                        about your train reservation. For instance, PNR status tells you if booking is confirmed or
                        youâ€™ll need to wait to get a seat if someone cancels their ticket. Apart from booking
                        confirmation, you also get to know the details of the train coach and berth, the fare paid by
                        you, and the departure and arrival date and timelines. Whatâ€™s more, you can check the PNR status
                        using your smartphone too. Below explains how you could do the same. Using PNR Number to check

                    <h3>Modes of PNR enquiry and how does it work? </h3>
                    <p>
                        You must be wondering whatâ€™s the mechanics behind a PNR enquiry; what are all the modes to enquire PNR and how does it work across channels. Well, here is all you need to know about it. In this era, you need not physically visit a railway station to make an enquiry to know the status of your ticket. You can very much do it using modern enquiry modes such as smartphone applications, web portals, via SMS, and final reservation charts of course. Now, the HOW part of it - when you buy a ticket using IRCTC portal or over the counter or via any third-party ticketing platform for that matter, a 10-digit number is generated. This number stores all the information about your train journey at CRIS (Centre Of Railway Information Systems), a database meant for storing passenger details. When you make an online PNR status enquiry, this number fetches the live PNR status from the database. You can reserve up to 6 seats in a single transaction and the online PNR status is going to show the reservation details of 6 of them. You may carry out another transaction to book tickets beyond six, if need be. An SMS service was launched initially by IRCTC to get live PNR status on your mobile. To avail this service all you have to do is, send a message to the service number in the following format: PNR space "Your PNR Number".

                    <h3>Understanding IRCTC PNR Status Abbreviations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The abbreviations found on a PNR number status page or on a ticket could read alien and you might wonder what do these terms mean? Here is help. Hereâ€™s a list of some abbreviated terms, their meaning and full forms that they stand for:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>CNF â€“ If you read this on your live PNR status, youâ€™ve got a â€˜Confirmedâ€™ ticket</span>
                        <span>RAC â€“ â€˜Reservation Against Cancellationâ€™ meaning that you are likely to get reservation in case someone cancels to travel. You can board the train though</span>
                        <span>WL â€“ â€˜Waiting Listâ€™ meaning that youâ€™re lined up to get a confirmed ticket only if one decides to cancel their booking. If the chart has been prepared and your IRCTC PNR status still says WL, you cannot board the train. There are other types of waiting lists as well including GNWL (General Waitlist), TQWL (Tatkal Waitlist), PQWL (Pooled Quota Waitlist), RLWL (Remote Location Waitlist), and NOSB (No Seat Berth)</span>
                        <span>CAN â€“ Ticket Cancelled.</span>
